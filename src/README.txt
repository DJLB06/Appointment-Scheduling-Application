HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM: Load the program and enter a valid username and password. In the lower left hand corner are the options to add, delete, or modify appointment information. In the bottom right the customer button will give access to the customer information screen where customers can be added, modified, or delted. Next to the customer information button is the view reports button that provides the option to generate reports based on appointment type, month, or country. You can also generate reports that show each contacts list of appointments.

ADDITIONAL REPORT: An additional report was added to show the number of customers in each country and list those customers in an easy to read table view.
